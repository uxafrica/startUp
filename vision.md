## Vision
> Proverbs 29:18a (King James Version,KJV)
> ** *Where there is no vision, the people perish:* ** 

The same applies to even companies and any endeavour that a man sets out to do.
Vision determines how far or close a company goes. 

Meaningful institutions are built on a vision.

If you do not know where you are going then any road will take you there.

Obviously letting a vision guide your team requires smart, motivated, and trustworthy people. In the world of startups that’s just table stakes.
When you see all activities as being useful, no activities are useful. 

In the topic of Vision, it is important to consider:

1. **Plan**
2. **Goals**
3. **Strategy**
4. **Tactics**
5. **Activities**

If you can't sit down to articulate you vision before you set out, you will most likely crumble a short while after you start.
This should be one of the most important exercises that any start-up tea and entrepreneur engages in.
Vision is the heartbeat of the start-Up being run.

A vision is about creating a short statement that will guide you over the next 5 years.  It should be specific enough to say something about what you will focus on entirely. It should be capable of driving the organization to achieve a common goal, and be somewhat motivational so that you have a constant reminder of what you are trying to achieve when the going gets tough.

Without a vision, a business is like a ship without a rudder and is in danger of drifting aimlessly. Many small businesses lack a clear vision and so they tend to jump from task to task without a clear understanding of what bonds the individual actions together and/or the value created by the individual actions. Your vision should provide the cornerstone for everything that you do in the business.

One of the greatest responsibility for the entrepreneur or business leader is to midwife a clear and shared vision for the company and to get commitment to and vigorous pursuit of that vision.
Research has shown that businesses that perform well over a long period had their leaders instill a compelling vision into the company while the company was relatively small.

If you have a clear vision, you will eventually attract the right strategy. If you don’t have a clear vision, no strategy will save you.




The vision has to be very specific Let’s examine the following vision statement and highlight some of the pitfalls it creates.

“I want to be the best company in the world”
This vision is not specific enough, it says nothing about what you will do and equally what you won’t do.  As such, you are unable to identify the key actions that you need to take and or define what success looks like.  Furthermore, what does the best mean? Does it refer to the number of employees in the business, having record sales and or profits?  As you can see this vision is in reality very weak and clearly does not provide the cornerstone for everything else that follows.

Let’s suppose you were looking to open a restaurant. Your vision, as well as the actions required to bring about success, would look very different depending on the type of restaurant.

Consider the following two visions:

“Providing quality fast food to the residents of Howard County at affordable prices”
“Providing Howard County residents with a premier fine dining experience”
If you look at the above visions it is clear that the focus and actions will be very different.  Marketing, Operations and the Skills required will also be very different.  In summary, your goals, actions and measurement criteria is driven by your vision.

Use the following guideline to create/evaluate your vision:

Your vision should be concise and give purpose to your business.
The vision must be capable of motivating you and others in the business.
The vision must provide the cornerstone for your business.  Helping you to link your actions to your strategic goals.  Your actions must be driven from a clear understanding of value they will create.
