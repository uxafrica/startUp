## Vision
> Proverbs 29:18a (King James Version,KJV)
> ** *Where there is no vision, the people perish:* ** 

The same applies to even companies and any endeavour that a man sets out to do.
Vision determines how far or close a company goes. 

Meaningful institutions are built on a vision.

If you do not know where you are going then any road will take you there.

Obviously letting a vision guide your team requires smart, motivated, and trustworthy people. In the world of startups thatâ€™s just table stakes.
When you see all activities as being useful, no activities are useful. 

In the topic of Vision, it is important to consider:

1. **Plan**
2. **Goals**
3. **Strategy**
4. **Tactics**
5. **Activities**

If you can't sit down to articulate you vision before you set out, you will most likely crumble a short while after you start.
Vision is the heartbeat of the start-Up being run.
